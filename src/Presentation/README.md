The `BadEcho.Presentation` library is the [Bad Echo](https://badecho.com) user interface framework for Windows Presentation Foundation. It provides a number of useful systems and individual components that aid in the creation of user interface applications powered by WPF.

A firm foundation for building model-view-viewmodel apps is provided by this library, and is used by Bad Echo applications such as the [Omnified](https://badecho.com/index.php/what-is-omnified/) game overlay platform [_Vision_](https://badecho.com/index.php/2022/02/14/vision/).

This package exists to be used by specific Bad Echo applications, but is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License so that others may enjoy it as well; see the accompanying [license](https://github.com/omniscientist/BadEcho/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, its ultimate focus and goal is to provide entertainment through the clever manipulation of games and the creation of new ones.

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!
